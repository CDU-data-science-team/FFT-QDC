You could make you web portals and links much better. I was sign posted to you by my GP during a telephone consultation, due to the GP not being able to provide links, I had to seek further information directly, using the internet.', 'Increase the promotion that continence can get better even for older people.', 'More education session per week, to reduce staying time.'
