', 'On one occasion I was not made aware that my appointment could not be kept until I arrived at the centre.', 'Communication regarding appointments.  I rang to confirm an appointment time, Thurs AM and was told it was Fri PM.  When no one turned up Fri I rang again and was told it was actually Thurs PM and that I had missed it.', 'Be more open with information about appointments.', 'You cancelled my appointment twice without telling me. It's been nearly two months and I still haven't been seen. I feel very neglected by this service.', 'Appointment details given over phone - no physical evidence/reminder which could cause problems. ', 'Be more specific with time of visit, i.e. early or late morning; early or late afternoon', 'would like to know first thing in the morning if getting physio would have like it one time a day not three time week.'
