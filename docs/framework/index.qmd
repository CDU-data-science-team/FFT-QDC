The framework consists of the categories and subcategories that the automated model with assign the qualitative data to. The framework has multiple categories, each with their own set of sub-categories. 
The current framework is displayed below:

When thinking about the categories and sub-categories, the categories can be thought of as the overarching heading grouping similar topics together in a meaningful way to help end users navigate the framework more easily. The sub-categories are more specific and better reflect the underlying data. 

Each sub-category has a description of what the data mapped there covers, for example:

Here are some examples of qualitative data that would map to the ‘Number & deployment of staff’ sub-category described above:

> 'Lots of staff'

> 'Staff shortages mean structured day activities can be cancelled at short notice & there is too much time wasted hanging around waiting to see if they run or not.'

> 'MORE STAFF PLEASE!!!!!!'

> 'Have less managers doing same job.'

> 'Staffing levels could improve. More recruitment, nursing assistants especially.'

> 'Would be good to have cover for support in situations where staff are off for extended periods due to holidays and sickness.'

> ‘Don't send trainee staff to people in crisis'

> 'The ward should only have female staff. Staff recruitment spoils what the ward does well.'
