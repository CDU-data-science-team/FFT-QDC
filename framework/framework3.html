We often try all the way from 6.30 to 7.30, the landline isn’t always any better.’, ‘You could and should update the information given on the website.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="appointment-arrangements">Appointment arrangements</h3>
<p>Comments (which can be quite wide ranging) relating to arrangements for appointments in terms of how frequently appointments/ check-ups/ home visits/ ongoing sessions occur, how convenient they are to attend, how long they last, how long people have to wait and punctuality of appointments, as well as cancellations. It also includes how patients have/would like to receive correspondence relating to their appointments e.g.&nbsp;via letter, telephone, text etc. and what it did/ they would they would like it to include.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Positive: ‘Appointment on time’, ‘1 1/2 hour appointment gave plenty of time for dIscussIons.’, ‘Good to be forewarned of vIsIt.’, ‘Kept to your word, rang back when you said you would.’ Negative/ wishlist: ‘Long wait for the appointment.’, ‘Really would like appointments closer together - they are too far apart’, ‘With covid, not enough home visits’, ‘Not many appts, wanted more time’, ‘Longer session and face to face if possible.’, ‘More physio and longer physio time.’, ‘Offering more varied time slots to fit around work.’, ‘Also, bare in mind that sometimes home/CPN visits can be quite inconvenient when you have young children.’, ‘Later appointment as 11am to early.’, ‘Just do the appointments according to times given to parents as it gets frustrating whilst waiting.’, ‘Come and see every day.’, ‘On one occasion I was not made aware that my appointment could not be kept until I arrived at the centre.’, ‘Communication regarding appointments. I rang to confirm an appointment time, Thurs AM and was told it was Fri PM. When no one turned up Fri I rang again and was told it was actually Thurs PM and that I had missed it.’, ‘Be more open with information about appointments.’, ‘You cancelled my appointment twice without telling me. It’s been nearly two months and I still haven’t been seen. I feel very neglected by this service.’, ‘Appointment details given over phone - no physical evidence/reminder which could cause problems.’, ‘Be more specific with time of visit, i.e.&nbsp;early or late morning; early or late afternoon’, ‘would like to know first thing in the morning if getting physio would have like it one time a day not three time week.’</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Mixed: ‘Sometimes the video conferences did not work, but I was happy to take the sessions by phone.’ Negative/ wishlist: ‘I think facetime appts would be better than just the phone. Sometimes hard to visualise exercise advice.’, ‘Due to COVID it had to be by telephone which I totally understand, face to face would have been better for me.’</p>

<p>Comments relating to the availability and existence of services, how quickly people are seen, treated, gain access to healthcare professionals/ services and have care arranged. This includes waiting times, how long people wait for ambulances to arrive and delays to treatment and support.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Positive: ‘There was little waiting time’, ‘Everything was arranged as soon as possible.’, ‘I was taken aback when my psychiatrist was able to see me a lot sooner at a time of crisis. This had never happened before.’, ‘A fast response.’, ‘My GP sent me a card asking me to self refer to physio during Covid 19. Received a call within 1 hour to book appointment.’, ’ most impressive was from arriving in the ambulance to being assessed and treated at a very fast speed’, ‘Time-response was within two hours of referral.’ Negative: ‘Shorter waiting times for treatment, took nearly 4 weeks to get this letter.’, ‘I would have liked to progress to Step 4 psychology quicker. At the moment I will have to wait 18 months before my treatment with them starts’, ‘Treatments could commence at a faster rate.’, ‘Waiting time was too long (about 2 months) especially when very worrying issues (i.e.&nbsp;heart).’, ‘All my contact with the Hope Centre has left me feeling desperate and frustrated. I was referred 18 months ago and, apart from my initial assessment, have yet to have any treatment.’, ‘The support given came to me some 5 months after my Stroke as my recovery I believe has been delayed due to this delay.’, ‘Excellent care, although It perhaps came a lIttle late.’, ‘Ambulance could have arrived sooner.’, ‘A two hour waiting time has led to health problems.’, ‘The telephone lady said would have to wait, but saying it was a stroke should have been quicker.’, ‘When I first contact the service he should have been but in a higher category straight away. From 8pm till 4am his was in ex stream pain.’</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="referals-continuity-of-care">Referals &amp; continuity of care</h3>
<p>Comments relating to referals, how well services are integrated and communicate with each other (e.g.&nbsp;the sharing of records, healthcare professionals knowledge of other services etc.). It also encorporates patient experiences around continuity of care and how smooth this is (i.e.&nbsp;in terms of negative experiences this can include descriptions of being lost in the system, falling between gaps, having to chase services themselves during transitions, for example from children to adult services etc.)</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Positive: ‘Getting in touch with health professionals such as my doctor to get stuff sorted quickly.’ Negative/ wishlist: ‘The original referral from my GP took longer than expected, because the service had moved offices, so it went to the wrong place.’, ‘Contact between hospItal and GP seemed to be lackIng.’, ‘Feedback to referrer accurately, and promptly giving an update. Improve communication between primary secondary care.’, ‘It took me 6-7 months to get the Manor Road team to refer me into the service, despite the SDS being ready to take me on as soon as they’d received the referral, because the psychiatrists I saw during that time had never heard of it and couldn’t be bothered to find out more.’, ‘I was referred 18 months ago and, apart from my initial assessment, have yet to have any treatment… During this telephone call I was told that the doctor was going to chase up my treatment… She warned me that I may get lost in the system though.’, ‘My 17 year old son was told that as he was turning 18 soon there was no point in offering him any treatment after a suicide attempt. He would have to wait until he was 18 and then get in touch with the adult service.’, ‘in the document it provided me with next steps I could take, but it wasn’t very clear in my opinion what I was supposed to do next, as it pointed me towards three different NHS therapy groups that all seemed very similar. It was difficult for me to know what to do, and I wish it was a bit smoother if possible.’</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="number-deployment-of-staff">Number &amp; deployment of staff</h3>
<p>Focusses on comments which explicitly reference the number of staff (staffing levels, shortages, too many, a lot, not enough etc.). It includes views and experiences around how staff are deployed and their skills mix (seniority, job role etc.), as well as references to the demographic make-up of staff (e.g.&nbsp;gender). It also incorporates comments around staff leave and recruitment.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Positive: ‘Lots of staff’, ‘plenty of members of staff who are working extremely hard to give excellent care and advice’ Negative/ wishlist: ‘More staff.’, ‘Staff shortages mean structured day activities can be cancelled at short notice &amp; there is too much time wasted hanging around waiting to see if they run or not.’, ‘MORE STAFF PLEASE!!!!!!’, ‘Have less managers doing same job.’, ’ Staffing levels could improve. More recruitment, nursing assistants especially.’, ‘Would be good to have cover for support in situations where staff are off for extended periods due to holidays and sickness.’, ‘I was offered various types of therapy through LMHT but these never happened due to staffing/delays.’, ‘Get more than one physio and occupational therapist in the team (I have missed out on both). Don’t send trainee staff to people in crisis (first person to see me bad).’, ‘Male members of staff are sometimes explicit in nature, this triggers my PTSD and want to leave. B2`should only have female staff. Staff recruitment spoils what B2 does well.’</p>

You make negligent mistakes. You make detrimental decisions on behalf of patients in the name of best interests when the only interests being served are your own. [Name] was a poor leader and [Name] is only marginally better. The clinical lead nurses are equally awful. There are a few well meaning and hard working nurses but on the whole they are a drop in what is a dysfunctional, unhelpful and chaotic team.
